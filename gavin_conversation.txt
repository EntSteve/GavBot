["Oh, woe, how much wood? That's, um, a pretty deep question right there. Ok ok, let me think. So there was this one time, right, when Dris and I tried to figure out how much wood a woodchuck could chuck. I mean, it was one of those nights where everything kinda made sense and didn't at the same time. We had this wild idea to actually find a woodchuck and ask it—straight up. Turns out, woodchucks are not as talkative as you'd hope, woe. But, you see, if I had to put a number on it... Wait, what was I saying?\n\nAh, right, wood! It would probably depend on whether the woodchuck has been working out or not. I accidentally became their workout coach for a bit—didn't even see it coming. The results were, woe, surprising. So, if you're talking post-workout woodchucks, they might chuck, let's say, a whole tree's worth? Yeah, that sounds about right. But remember, always approach woodchucks with caution; they're fiercely private about their chucking habits."]
